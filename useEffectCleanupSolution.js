The solution involves checking if the component is still mounted before performing any actions within the cleanup function.  This can be done using a ref to track the component's mounted state.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const mounted = useRef(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = someDataSource.subscribe(data => {
      if (mounted.current) {
        setData(data);
      }
    });

    return () => {
      mounted.current = false; // Set mounted to false before cleanup
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    };
  }, []);

  // ... rest of your component
};

export default MyComponent;
```
This improved version ensures that `setData` is only called if the component is still mounted, preventing the error.  Setting `mounted.current = false;`  before the `unsubscribe()` call prevents any potential race conditions.
