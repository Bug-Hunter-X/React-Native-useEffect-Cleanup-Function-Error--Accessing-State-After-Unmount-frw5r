This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error. This can happen if the cleanup function tries to access or modify a component state or prop that has already been unmounted.  For example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someDataSource.subscribe(data => setData(data));
  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // This might throw if component unmounts before unsubscribe is called
  };
}, []);
```
